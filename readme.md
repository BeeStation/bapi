# <p align=center>BeeStation API</p>

Welcome to the experience of a lifetime. You have stumbled upon the one and only BeeStation API GitHub repository. Now that you're here, your life will never be the same as it once was. Relax. Give yourself a minute to take it all in. I know it's hard to believe what you're seeing. It was hard for me the first time too. When you're mentally prepared, go ahead and scroll down to read the contributing instructions; only if you feel worthy, of course.

## Contributing

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and run `poetry install` within the base directory. This will create a new virtual environment and install all the needed dependencies.

Once the environment has been setup, run `poetry run pre-commit install` to add the git hooks.
